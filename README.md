This project was born from a challenge for a React development wave, where I decided to turn it into an open source application for other developers to use and improve both the interface and the code itself.

## Requeriments
- Node >= 10.16.3
- Yarn >= 1.19.1

### Getting started
No many secrets around here. Following the challenge instructions, the application was developed using Expo (in branch 1.0.0 you can run using React Native). Therefore, to start the application just follow the steps below.

```js
// Clone the project
$ git clone https://github.com/LeuAlmeida/app.october.git

// Go to the application folder
$ cd app.october

// Installing the dependencies
$ yarn

// Starting using Expo CLI
$ yarn start

```
